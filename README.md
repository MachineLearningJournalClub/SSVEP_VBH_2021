### Python 

#### Machine Learning

* [PyMDE](https://pymde.org/index.html) is a Python library for computing vector [embeddings](https://pymde.org/getting_started/index.html#embedding-definition) of items, such as images, biological cells, nodes in a network, or any other type of abstract object. The embeddings are designed to minimally distort relationships between pairs of items, while possibly satisfying some constraints. PyMDE is based on the monograph *[Minimum-Distortion Embedding](https://web.stanford.edu/~boyd/papers/min_dist_emb.html)*, which introduced a simple but general framework for embedding.

* [pyRiemann](https://pyriemann.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) is a Python machine learning library based on scikit-learn API. It provides a high-level interface for classification and manipulation of multivariate signal through Riemannian Geometry of covariance matrices. pyRiemann aims at being a generic package for multivariate signal classification but has been designed around applications of **biosignal (M/EEG, EMG, etc) classification**.

  

  #### Signal Processing and Feature Extraction

* [MNE](https://mne.tools/stable/index.html): Open-source Python package for exploring, visualizing, and analyzing human neurophysiological data: MEG, EEG, sEEG, ECoG, NIRS, and more.

* [EMD: Empirical Mode Decomposition](https://emd.readthedocs.io/en/stable/index.html) .  Python tools for the extraction and analysis of non-linear and non-stationary oscillatory signals
